                      From the moment I could string together sentences, a
                      passionate curiosity for creation has been my constant
                      companion. My first encounter with programming occurred at
                      the tender age of six, a mere fortnight after my mother
                      introduced me to our gleaming new Pentium III. On this
                      technological marvel, I embarked on a self-taught typing
                      journey.

                    <p>
                      Interestingly, it was my distaste for monotony that nudged
                      me towards the fascinating world of coding. I was irked by
                      the repetitive tasks that my PC demanded of me and
                      thought, &quot;Why not delegate this to the machine?&quot;
                      Thus, I found myself immersed in the realms of Visual
                      Basic and later, AutoIt, enabling me to automate the
                      tedious chores on my PC.

                      My leisure hours were filled with the thrill of video
                      gaming. However, when the games started to lose their
                      charm, I turned my coding skills towards crafting bots and
                      cheats, purely for amusement. My toolbox included AutoIt
                      for creating auto-clicker bots using pixel detection,
                      Cheat Engine for games that housed variables client-side,
                      and eventually, I discovered the capabilities of WPE Pro.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      WPE Pro, a prominent packet editor, was predominantly used
                      for manipulating multiplayer games. While it made hacking
                      client-side games a walk in the park, I soon found myself
                      yearning for a more formidable challenge. This was when
                      the expansive universe of the Web caught my attention.
                      With a newfound understanding of ethical responsibilities,
                      I decided that my future lay in more constructive
                      endeavours.

                      By the age of 14, I was fluent in XHTML and CSS basics. My
                      high school years further enriched my programming arsenal
                      with Javascript, PHP, and MySQL.

                      Today, I hold a cherished place within the Poslovi
                      Infostud team, an exceptional collective that&apos;s
                      dedicated to bridging the gap between job seekers and
                      their dream roles. It&apos;s an honor to employ my talents
                      in this crucial mission, fueling my enduring passion for
                      innovative solutions and creative problem-solving.
